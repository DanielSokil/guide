# Control Expressions

In Mint everything is an expression so all control structures are returning some value, that is why they are called **control expressions**.

There are four control expressions in total:

* **if...else** - basic conditional expression 
* **case** -  allows returning a value based on an other value
* **try** - allows handling **synchronous** computation that might fail
* **do** - allows handling **asynchronous** computation that might fail
