# Mint

Mint is a refreshing, strongly typed, expression-oriented programming language for the front-end web.

It tries to solve most common issues of **Single Page Applications \(SPAs\)**:

* Reusable components
* Styling
* Routing
* Global and local state handling
* Synchronous and asynchronous computations that might fail

While focusing on:

* Developer happiness
* Fast compilation
* Readability
